# Tripeaks Solitaire
A score based solitaire game.
## Instructions
Your goal is to remove all cards from the pyramids.

The card in the bottom right is "in play". Valid moves are clicking face-up cards in the pyramids that are either one higher or one lower than the card that is in play.

Ex: Bottom right card is a 6, valid moves are 5 or 7. Suit doesn't matter.
Ex: Bottom right card is an ace, valid moves are 2 or king. Suit doesn't matter.

You are awarded your current score streak in points for every consecutive move you make without hitting the pile (bottom left) which resets your streak and subtracts 5 from your score.

## Important notes/known issues
- adblocker will block card images because they are urls (bad, its on the todo list)
- all work is on treeStructure



TODO:
change it so that server does redirect and validation check - no open routes for users?
figure out how to make testing easier
download card images into images folder
