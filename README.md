# Q1Project
I want to deploy with firebase because I haven't used it before and I want to use bootstrap for styling because we have mostly dealt with Materialize


## Idea 1 - Game

I just really like the thought of implementing game logic code - so maybe a card game or a "clicker" type idle game
API - playing card API?


## Idea 2 - JobMap

indeed or simply hired API for finding job listings, then google maps api to plot them on a map


## Idea 3 - DataVis

some sort of data visualization - using an API for data retrieval of some sort then use keen.io or google dev charts to plot it
