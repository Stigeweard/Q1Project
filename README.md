# Tripeaks Solitaire
A score based solitaire game.
## Instructions
Your goal is to remove all cards from the pyramids.

The card in the bottom right is "in play". Valid moves are clicking face-up cards in the pyramids that are either one higher or one lower than the card that is in play.

Ex: Bottom right card is a 6, valid moves are 5 or 7. Suit doesn't matter.
Ex: Bottom right card is an ace, valid moves are 2 or king. Suit doesn't matter.

You are awarded your current score streak in points for every consecutive move you make without hitting the pile (bottom left) which resets your streak and subtracts 5 from your score.

TODO:
limit username length to 8 characters
change it so that server does redirect and validation check - no open routes for users?
