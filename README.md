# TriPeaks Solitaire

This is my Q2 project at galvanize and it is a refactored, hosted version of my Q1 project.

Features include:
-sign up/login with hashed passwords and stored in a postgres database
-recursion on an edge list to populate card data and game state into a tree structure
-hosted on heroku at tripeaks.herokuapp.com
